# Machine Learning-Based Facial Recognition for Financial Fraud Prevention

# ABSTRACT
Facial recognition technology, powered by machine learning, has become a cornerstone in securing financial systems against fraud. With applications ranging from identity verification to transaction monitoring, this technology provides robust mechanisms to detect and prevent fraudulent activities in real-time. However, challenges such as face spoofing and deep forgeries have emerged, necessitating advanced solutions. By employing machine learning algorithms and big data analytics, facial recognition systems can enhance fraud detection accuracy, reduce risks, and improve the reliability of financial operations. Additionally, advancements in sensor technology and algorithmic optimizations are critical in developing secure and efficient systems, ensuring seamless integration into financial applications and safeguarding sensitive information.
